# Family Media Player

Because life is too short to listen to music you don't want to ever hear again, and you hate it when you're not allowed to click the skip button.

Family Media Player is a media player with the family in mind.

It's for people who have a large music/video library and who DON'T want to be tracked by a corporation, and don't want to run the risk of loosing all their favorite tunes if a company goes out of business.

FMP currently doesn't have playlists, instead it creates a never ending queue based on your listening habits and ratings.

# Metrics
- Rate a file 0 and it'll never be cued for you again.
- The higher the rating the more a file gets played.
- "Skip" a file and the "score" goes down.
- Listen to a file completely and the "score" goes up.
